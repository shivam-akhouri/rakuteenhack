# Harness Social Media/Public Platforms To Source Qualified Leads

Open platforms like Twitter, FB, Mouth shut, Quora etc are considered to be neutral platforms where people share their experience about products, services and brands. The objective is to harness these platforms to identify and generate leads and prospects by applying website scrapping, text analytics, AI and push filtered data to Analytics engine for further processing.

## OUR SOLUTION

==> Our web application gives users the chance to join a community that uses customer collaboration to promote brands,
suggest products, and offer a forum for direct dialogue between influencers and interested parties.

==> The interested parties can take advantage of a variety of benefits, including speaking with existing customers or influencers, 
learning in-depth about the product of interest, getting any queries resolved, and receiving the best quote on any insurance 
Bajaj Allianz offers in all markets.

==> Existing customers have the opportunity to become influencers on our website. 
We have a special influencer programme that is essentially an incentive-based points-reward system, 
wherein the influencer will receive a certain number of points for each interested party
that they convert into a customer as well as for performing product digital marketing activities, among other things. 
These points will qualify you for incentives like cash, Amazon gift cards, and other goods.
